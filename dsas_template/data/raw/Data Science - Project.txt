1. Background and Motivation:
   * Why did you choose this topic?
   * Why is it important or interesting?
   * How does this project fit into the broader context of data science or the problem area you're addressing?
We chose this topic because, as young adults, we’ve grown up watching many different types of movies and series that show how fast the film industry has evolved. Over time, we’ve seen the shift from traditional filmmaking to productions using new technologies like 3D, CGI and Artificial Intelligence. For us, cinema and TV are not just about entertainment, they also reflect society, culture, and the way people think and feel in different eras.
By studying how public tastes and film characteristics (such as genre, budget, duration, and country of origin) have changed from the 1990s to today, we can better understand how the global film industry has developed. This topic is interesting because it connects art, culture, society and data science.
From a data science perspective, our project shows how data can be used to explore cultural and historical trends. Using film datasets, we can turn creative aspects of cinema into measurable patterns and discover how technology, audience preferences, and globalization have shaped the movies we watch today.
This topic is particularly relevant to data science because it combines quantitative (ratings, revenues) and qualitative (genres, languages) features, it allows the use of data visualization, time-series analysis, and clustering to reveal patterns in cultural production. It also demonstrates how data can help understand societal and industrial changes through entertainment.
2. Project Objectives:
   * Clearly state the goals of your project. What do you aim to achieve?
   * Specify if your objective is to build a predictive model, conduct exploratory analysis, create visualizations, etc.
The main goal of our project is to analyze how the characteristics and preferences of the global film industry evolve over the 1990s to 2025 time period. We will more specifically focus on conducting an EDA to identify major changes in film genres, budgets, ratings and production countries. We will visualize decade trends (which genre dominated each era, how films durations and budgets evolved). We will try to investigate possible correlations between budgets and ratings. We will present the findings in clear and engaging data visualizations (like bar plots, line charts, heatmaps, word clouds...).
This is not a predictive project, our focus is on exploration, pattern discovery and storytelling through data.
3. Research Questions:
   * Outline the key questions your project will aim to answer.
   * How do these questions relate to the data you are planning to collect?
Our main question is: How public tastes and film characteristics (genres, budget, origins, duration…) evolve in the global film industry between 1990 and 2025?
Sub-questions:
* Which film genres dominated each decade?
* How have movie budgets evolved over time?
* Is there a correlation between a film’s budget and its IMDb rating?
* Are modern films longer than those from the 1990s?
* Which countries have dominated global film production over different periods?
* Do the highest-rated films consistently come from the same regions?


4. Data Source:
   * What is the source of your data?
   * How do you plan to collect or acquire this data (e.g., publicly available datasets, web scraping, APIs)?
   * Mention if there are any limitations or challenges in acquiring or using the data.
Our dataset comes from Kaggle, a data source/website provided by our teacher, specifically from the dataset titled “IMDb Movies from 1920 to 2025”, created and published by Raed Addala (the link : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/raedaddala/imdb-movies-from-1960-to-2023/data).
We used the cleaned version of the file, which we downloaded in .csv format for easier manipulation in Python. The dataset contains ~ 60’000 movies spanning from 1920 to 2025 and includes 23 variables describing each film, such as : 
1. Title : Name of the movie
2. Year / Release date : Production and release timeline
3. Genre(s) : One or multiple genres per film
4. Duration : Film length (in hours and minutes)
5. IMDb Rating : Audience evaluation (from 1 to 10)
6. Votes : Number of ratings submitted
7. Budget / Gross / Worldwide Gross : Financial indicators
8. Country of Origin / Filming locations : Geographic scope
9. Production Companies, Writers, Directors, Awards : Metadata for qualitative analysis
10. Languages : For cultural and linguistic diversity analysis
It provides a comprehensive view of how the global film industry has evolved over time, both culturally (genres, countries) and economically (budgets, box-office results).
The dataset is publicly available and was downloaded directly from Kaggle, an open platform that hosts thousands of verified datasets for data analysis and machine learning. No web scraping or API access was required. The data was already well-structured and almost cleaned, making it suitable for immediate use in our project. We imported it into Python (via pandas) for analysis and exploration.
For the limitations : 
1. Missing values : Some info (like budgets or revenues) is missing, especially for older films
2. Inflation : Budgets and revenues aren’t adjusted for inflation, so decade comparisons need care
3. Western bias : The data mainly covers Hollywood and Western movies, with fewer films from Asia, Africa, or South America. This can make it harder to get a truly global view of the film industry.
4. Subjective ratings : IMDb scores are user-based and can reflect cultural or regional bias
5. Data cleaning : Collecting data is only the first step, cleaning, merging, and organizing it takes time and can introduce errors if not done carefully


5. Data Description:
   * Provide an overview of the key features of the data, including the variables you expect to work with.
   * Describe the format and size of the data, and any cleaning steps you foresee.
Format: CSV file (21600 rows and 23 columns)
Key variables: Year, Duration, Genre, Rating, Budget, Gross income, Country of origin
Planned preprocessing steps: Convert Duration like (“2h 10m”) into numeric minutes. Clean and standardize Budget and Gross columns (remove symbols like “$” and “,”). Extract the first genre from Genre(s) for easier classification. Handle missing or inconsistent values.
6. Schedule & Timeline:
   * Provide a brief timeline for your project.
   * Highlight major milestones, such as data collection, analysis stages, and expected results.
We made a 7 weeks timeline that we will adapt based on our project's advancement (with 1 “free week” that can be used in case of delay). Our way of working is that work will be distributed according to each member's strengths, with regular sync-up meetings to share progress, troubleshoot, and support each other.
